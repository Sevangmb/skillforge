## üõ† **Technical Implementation Guide**

### Development Workflow

#### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install new dependencies
npm install zustand recharts @types/recharts

# Development commands
npm run dev      # Local development
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # Code quality check
```

#### 2. Component Integration Strategy

**A. Gradual Migration Approach**
1. Create new components alongside existing ones
2. Implement feature flags for A/B testing
3. Migrate users progressively
4. Remove old components after validation

**B. Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests for store operations
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance testing for mobile devices

#### 3. Performance Considerations

**Bundle Size Optimization**
- Lazy load analytics components
- Code split by feature areas
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement service worker for caching

**Runtime Performance**
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize re-renders with proper dependencies
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
